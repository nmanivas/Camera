This project uses Robot Operating System(ROS) and Open CV to control a PTZ camera and multiple USB cameras.
Blob detection capablity has not been built into it yet. but you can find a test  code in the corresponding test directory.
It was part of the NASA RASC-AL rover building contest. If anyone has any issues please do mail me at :nmanivas@buffalo.edu
